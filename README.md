## Meeting Insighter
Meeting Insighter is a Python-based tool designed to streamline the process of transcribing and analyzing meeting audio files. By harnessing the power of OpenAI's cutting-edge Whisper-1 and GPT-4 models, this project offers a seamless solution for converting speech to text and extracting meaningful insights from meeting discussions.

## Key Features
* Audio Transcription: Utilizes OpenAI's Whisper-1 model to accurately transcribe audio files from meetings into text.
* Meeting Analysis: Leverages the advanced natural language processing capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4 to analyze and summarize key points, actions, and decisions from the transcribed text.
* Scalable and Flexible: Designed to handle multiple audio formats and adaptable for various meeting types and sizes.
  
## How It Works
1. Transcription: Users upload their meeting audio files into audio_files folder. The system employs the Whisper-1 model to transcribe these files into text with high accuracy.
2. Analysis: The transcribed text is then processed by the GPT-4 model, which generates concise and relevant summaries, highlights action items, and identifies key discussion points.
3. Output: Users receive a structured summary of their meeting, enabling them to quickly grasp essential information and follow up on action items.
   
## Future Scope
* Development of a web interface for an enhanced user experience.
* Integration of additional features such as sentiment analysis, topic categorization, and automated minute generation.
* Continuous improvements in accuracy and efficiency through model updates and feedback.
